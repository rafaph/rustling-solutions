# rustlings solutions ü¶Ä‚ù§Ô∏è

This repo contains my solutions for rustlings, feel free to see all of it. :)

You can find the oficial rustlings repository here: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings

Good luck!

## Getting Started

Before you begin, keep in mind that this solutions are for rustlings tag version 5.2.1 released at 2022-09-06.

_Note: If you're on MacOS, make sure you've installed Xcode and its developer tools by typing `xcode-select --install`._
_Note: If you're on Linux, make sure you've installed gcc. Deb: `sudo apt install gcc`. Yum: `sudo yum -y install gcc`._

You will need to have Rust installed. You can get it by visiting https://rustup.rs. This'll also install Cargo, Rust's package/project manager.

Clone the repository and run `cargo install --path .`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafaph/rustlings-solutions.git rustlings/
cd rustlings
cargo install --force --path .
```

If there are installation errors, ensure that your toolchain is up to date. For the latest, run:

```bash
rustup update
```

Then, same as above, run `rustlings` to get started.

## Doing exercises

The exercises are sorted by topic and can be found in the subdirectory `rustlings/exercises/<topic>`. For every topic there is an additional README file with some resources to get you started on the topic. We really recommend that you have a look at them before you start.

The task is simple. Most exercises contain an error that keeps them from compiling, and it's up to you to fix it! Some exercises are also run as tests, but rustlings handles them all the same. To run the exercises in the recommended order, execute:

```bash
rustlings watch
```

This will try to verify the completion of every exercise in a predetermined order (what we think is best for newcomers). It will also rerun automatically every time you change a file in the `exercises/` directory. If you want to only run it once, you can use:

```bash
rustlings verify
```

This will do the same as watch, but it'll quit after running.

In case you want to go by your own order, or want to only verify a single exercise, you can run:

```bash
rustlings run myExercise1
```

Or simply use the following command to run the next unsolved exercise in the course:

```bash
rustlings run next
```

In case you get stuck, you can run the following command to get a hint for your
exercise:

```bash
rustlings hint myExercise1
```

You can also get the hint for the next unsolved exercise with the following command:

```bash
rustlings hint next
```

To check your progress, you can run the following command:

```bash
rustlings list
```

## Testing yourself

After every couple of sections, there will be a quiz that'll test your knowledge on a bunch of sections at once. These quizzes are found in `exercises/quizN.rs`.

## Enabling `rust-analyzer`

Run the command `rustlings lsp` which will generate a `rust-project.json` at the root of the project, this allows [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) to parse each exercise. 

## Continuing On

Once you've completed Rustlings, put your new knowledge to good use! Continue practicing your Rust skills by building your own projects, contributing to Rustlings, or finding other open-source projects to contribute to.

## Uninstalling Rustlings

If you want to remove Rustlings from your system, there are two steps. First, you'll need to remove the exercises folder that the install script created
for you:

```bash
rm -rf rustlings # or your custom folder name, if you chose and or renamed it
```

Second, since Rustlings got installed via `cargo install`, it's only reasonable to assume that you can also remove it using Cargo, and
exactly that is the case. Run `cargo uninstall` to remove the `rustlings` binary:

```bash
cargo uninstall rustlings
```

Now you should be done!
